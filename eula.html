    <h1>End User License Agreement (EULA)</h1>
    <p class="card" style="color: var(--text); font-weight: 600;">Licensed Application End User License Agreement (Standard Apple EULA)</p>
    <div class="card">
      <h2>a. Scope of License</h2>
      <p>Licensor grants you a nontransferable license to use the Licensed Application on any Apple-branded products you own or control as permitted by the Usage Rules. The Standard EULA governs any content, materials, or services accessible from or purchased within the Licensed Application as well as upgrades provided by the Licensor that replace or supplement the original Licensed Application, unless such upgrade is accompanied by a Custom EULA. Except as provided in the Usage Rules, you may not distribute or make the Licensed Application available over a network where it could be used by multiple devices at the same time. You may not transfer, redistribute, or sublicense the Licensed Application and, if you sell your Apple Device, you must remove the Licensed Application before doing so. You may not copy, reverse-engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, modify, or create derivative works of the Licensed Application, any updates, or any part thereof, except as permitted by applicable law.</p>

      <h2>b. Consent to Use of Data</h2>
      <p>You agree that Licensor may collect and use technical data and related information—including technical information about your device, system and application software, and peripherals—that is gathered periodically to facilitate the provision of software updates, product support, and other services to you (if any) related to the Licensed Application. Licensor may use this information, as long as it is in a form that does not personally identify you, to improve its products or to provide services or technologies to you.</p>

      <h2>c. Termination</h2>
      <p>This Standard EULA is effective until terminated by you or Licensor. Your rights will terminate automatically if you fail to comply with any of its terms.</p>

      <h2>d. External Services</h2>
      <p>The Licensed Application may enable access to Licensor’s and/or third-party services and websites ("External Services"). You agree to use the External Services at your sole risk. Licensor is not responsible for examining or evaluating the content or accuracy of any third-party External Services and shall not be liable for them. Data displayed by any Licensed Application or External Service is for general informational purposes only. You will not use the External Services in any manner inconsistent with this Standard EULA or that infringes the rights of Licensor or any third party. External Services may not be available in all languages or locations, and may not be appropriate or available for use in any particular location. To the extent you choose to use such External Services, you are solely responsible for compliance with any applicable laws. Licensor reserves the right to change, suspend, remove, disable, or impose access restrictions on any External Services at any time without notice or liability.</p>

      <h2>e. No Warranty</h2>
      <p>YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT USE OF THE LICENSED APPLICATION IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE LICENSED APPLICATION AND ANY SERVICES PERFORMED OR PROVIDED BY THE LICENSED APPLICATION ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE," WITH ALL FAULTS AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, AND LICENSOR HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE LICENSED APPLICATION AND ANY SERVICES, EITHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY.</p>

      <h2>f. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR PERSONAL INJURY OR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR ANY OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE LICENSED APPLICATION, HOWEVER CAUSED, REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY AND EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR PERSONAL INJURY, OR OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IN NO EVENT SHALL LICENSOR’S TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ALL DAMAGES EXCEED FIFTY DOLLARS ($50.00).</p>

      <h2>g. Export Restrictions</h2>
      <p>You may not use or otherwise export or re-export the Licensed Application except as authorized by United States law and the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Licensed Application was obtained. The Licensed Application may not be exported or re-exported (a) into any U.S.-embargoed countries or (b) to anyone on the U.S. Treasury Department's Specially Designated Nationals List or the U.S. Department of Commerce Denied Persons List or Entity List.</p>

      <h2>h. U.S. Government End Users</h2>
      <p>The Licensed Application and related documentation are "Commercial Items," consisting of "Commercial Computer Software" and "Commercial Computer Software Documentation," as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. §12.212 or 48 C.F.R. §227.7202. The Commercial Computer Software and Commercial Computer Software Documentation are being licensed to U.S. Government end users (a) only as Commercial Items and (b) with only those rights as are granted to all other end users pursuant to the terms and conditions herein.</p>

      <h2>i. Governing Law</h2>
      <p>Except to the extent expressly provided otherwise, this Agreement and the relationship between you and Licensor shall be governed by the laws of the State of California, excluding its conflicts of law provisions. You and Licensor agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within Santa Clara County, California, to resolve any dispute or claim arising from this Agreement. The United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods does not apply.</p>
